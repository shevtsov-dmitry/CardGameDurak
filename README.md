Coding Card Game "Durak"
Hello everybody who will read this.
It's my first Java project. I'm currently learning Java Core and this is my first idea that came out to my head.
I recon card game is a good way to try first steps with OOP programming paradigm and writing algorithms&logic.
There are a lot of rules in Durak, but I can explain main goal briefly. 
One "con" game be played by 2-6 people. There is 36 cards. People are taking cards until they have at least 6 in their hands.
Game lasts until player have no more cards left. The last one who has at least one card loses the game.
And main logic how you can beat enemy's cards is hierarchy of types and card suit ( for example 6 ♤ is less then 9 ♤ that means you can beat up enemy's 6)
If he has 9 too he can play it, if you don't have anything like  trump ( card that can be any card, but not the same suit by hierarchy ) you have to take
all these cards. Means your opponent has an advantage. 
So that's it. Pretty interesting. Forget to mention if there are more than 2 players the game plays by circle clockwise.
